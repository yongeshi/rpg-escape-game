# rpg-escape-game
JavaFX game built on Eclipse.

The object of the game is to escape the room. The player must obtain the key in order to exit the room. Use the arrow keys to move the player around. Move your character around the objects of the room and press the space bar to check if the key is there. Once the key is obtained, the player may exit the room via the stairs.

Images and character sprite were all personally designed and created. The RPG world background and character sprite were designed with RPG Maker MZ. You can customize your own RPG world background/sprite and and replace the images in the files.

TODO: 
-Make it deployable so that i can share it to others: Recreate this with a new JavaFX project via the e(fx)clipse plugin (gives access to a fxbuild file) - convert and build with Gradle
-Maybe look into uploading a runnable .jar file and making an .exe file with Launch4j to be able to share with friends/family
